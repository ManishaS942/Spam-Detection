# A comprehensive study of spam detection in e-mails

different spam-detection methodologies are established and employed to classify spam e-mails and regular (legitimate) e-mails. For classification, k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) is used as the frequency of occurrence of spam and legitimate emails are seen to be comparable in the data set used. Further Bio-inspired optimization algorithms integrated with k-NN classification have been used to optimize the results of classification.
